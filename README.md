	This repository contains my Twine narrative that revolves around King Henry VIII's six wives and the sequence of their lives. I include details about each queenâ€™s life before, during, and after their marriage to the King. The audience can input their name and choose a queen they are interested in. The writing style of this Twine narrative is casual and comedic. I write as if I am friendly with the player of the game, use humorous language, and incorporate memes that are popular with the current generation. 
	The Twine narrative has advanced functions to increase the quality of the game and be more engaging to the audience. I included multimedia, specifically historical memes I have created and found funny. The font and color of the text differ depending on which queen you decide to learn more about. Each queen has two colors designated to them. I have incorporated conditionals throughout the game so the text does not appear all at once but after a certain amount of time. Lastly, I created a space for the player to type in their name in the introduction for the variable feature. This feature allows the audience member to be addressed during the game as if the game is directly speaking to them.
